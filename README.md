#What is this?

This Xposed Module will bypass the Root detection in the TVNZ OnDemand app.

When you attempt to watch an OnDemand TV show, you will see a popup which says rooted devices are not supported.

##How do I use it?

You will need to have the Xposed Framework installed on your device.

Once you have Xposed installed, either build this Xposed Module from sources, or [Download the APK](./TVNZ Root Unblocker.apk)
